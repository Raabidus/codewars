#Your task is to write an update for a lottery machine. Its current version produces a sequence of random letters and integers (passed as a string to the function).
#Your code must filter out all letters and return unique integers as a string, in their order of first appearance.
#If there are no integers in the string return "One more run!"

#Examples
#"hPrBKWDH8yc6Lt5NQZWQ"  -->  "865"
#"ynMAisVpHEqpqHBqTrwH"  -->  "One more run!"
#"555"                   -->  "5"

def lottery(s):
    result = ''
    for i in s:
        if i.isdigit() and i not in result:
            result += i
    return result or 'One more run!'
